# Sentry
Demonstrate how to avoid noise in the Sentry Reporting-Javascript

Sentry offers application monitoring for different platforms like javascript, java, python and so on. 
This allows to keep track of issues in the releases and also control any roadblocking issues at the earliest before it affects the larger user base.
Due to increase in open source libraries and tools, most projects tend to use these open source libraries which enable them with faster to market. 
But project team will not be responsible in fixing issues in the libraries so sentry allows to skip the reporting of issues generated in the 
library by simple configuration.


skip reporting issues from library by using denyUrls.
